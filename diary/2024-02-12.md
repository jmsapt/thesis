# 2024T1 - Week 1

## Monday 2024-02-12
- First day of term (and of thesis), spent setting up my development evironment. This included
fixing missing dependencies, setting up the repo, and other general house keeping
- Will likely use the game engine `bevy` over raw `wgpu` (`bevy` is built ontop of `wgpu`) as I 
don't want to reinvent the wheel doing simply things like drawing meshes, or setting up a 3d camera
- My current plan for work time is spend majority of Monday, part of Tuesday, and some more time over 
the weekend working on my thesis, ideally totaling about 16 hours per week of work
- Plan for the rest of the week is just getting familar with the engine, and doing some intial 
reading into incompressible flow CFD algorithms (like SIMPLE).
- I will not actually start building anything until Week 2
